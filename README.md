# sqlalchemy

Contributor: Alex Calametti 

Overview: 

The main goal of this project is to analyze a climate database to visualize precipitation and temperature data collected from different weather stations in Hawaii before a planned vacation. This activity works to help gain more practice using SQLAlchemy and ORM queries as well as a website powered by FLask. The name of files used, programs needed, steps taken to create the vizualizations, and Flask set up are included below. 

What you need: 

-   Databases: hawaii.sqlite, hawaii_measurements.csv, hawaii_stations.csv

-   Libraries/Programs: Pandas, Matplotlib, SQLAlchemy, Flask

-   Starter Code: climate_starter.ipynb and app.py
